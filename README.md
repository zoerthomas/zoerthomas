# Hi there, I'm Zoe!

### I started my career in the third sector, but I'd always had a passion for tech... 

When my role required some data analysis, I fell in love with coding. 

After many self taught hours and completing the <b><a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/cfgdegree/"> CodeFirstGirls</a></b> nanodegree, I got my first job as a full stack junior dev.
